"""
Unit tests for the main application of the Neighbour Approved backend.

This module tests key aspects of the FastAPI application initialization,
including:
- Application startup behavior.
- OpenAPI schema generation.
- Application metadata (title, description, version).
- CORS middleware configuration.

The tests help ensure that the application is properly configured before
handling incoming requests.

        - HTTP status code 404.

def test_cors_headers(test_client):
    """
    Test that CORS headers are properly set in responses based on allowed origins.

    This test sends a GET request with an Origin header to a known endpoint ("/openapi.json")
    and then checks whether the response includes the "access-control-allow-origin" header.
    The expected outcome depends on the applicationâ€™s CORS settings:

    - If the provided Origin is allowed (or if "*" is configured), the response should include
      the "access-control-allow-origin" header with a value equal to the Origin or "*".
    - Otherwise, the header will not be present.

    Expected Outcome:
        - If the test origin is allowed, the header "access-control-allow-origin" is present and its
          value is either the test origin or "*".
        - If the test origin is not allowed, the header will be absent.
