# Health Check Documentation

## Overview

The health check module provides endpoints for system monitoring and status verification. These endpoints allow clients to check if the API is running correctly and get information about the system's health.

## Components

### Health Router (`app/api/v1/endpoints/system/health/health_router.py`)

The health router defines the router configuration for health-related endpoints:

- **Prefix**: "/health"
- **Tags**: ["System", "Health"]

This allows for all health-related endpoints to be grouped together logically in the API structure and documentation.

### Health Check Endpoint (`app/api/v1/endpoints/system/health/health_check.py`)

The health check endpoint provides a simple way to verify that the API is running:

- **Path**: GET `/api/v1/system/health/health_check`
- **Response**: JSON object with status and version
- **Purpose**: Basic verification that the API is operational

#### Response Format

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "version": "0.1.0"
}
```

## Usage

The health check endpoint can be used for:

- Monitoring systems to verify the API is responsive
- Load balancers to determine if the service is healthy
- Deployment checks to confirm successful deployment

## Extension

Additional health endpoints can be added to the health router to provide more detailed system information, such as:

- Database connectivity status
- External service dependencies status
- System metrics (memory usage, request count, etc.)

### Example: Database Health Check

A database health check endpoint could be added to verify database connectivity:

```python
@health_router.get("/database")
async def database_health():
    """
    Check if the database connection is working properly.
    
    Returns:
        dict: Status of the database connection
    """
    try:
        # Test database connection
        result = await db.execute("SELECT 1")
        return {"status": "ok", "details": "Database connection successful"}
    except Exception as e:
        return {
            "status": "error",
            "details": f"Database connection failed: {str(e)}"
        }
```

## Implementation Notes

- Health checks should be lightweight and fast
- They should not require authentication
- They should return appropriate HTTP status codes
- They should provide clear, actionable information about issues
