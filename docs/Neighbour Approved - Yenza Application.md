**Which industries do you operate in?**\
Tech-Enabled Community Platforms, Software Development

**What type of start-up are you?**\
Tech Venture

**What is your business model?**

**Operating Model**\
Neighbour Approved operates with a lean methodology influenced by Extreme Programming (XP) and Kanban principles, ensuring efficiency and adaptability. In practice, this means prioritising iterative development, implementing continuous feedback loops, and delivering small, valuable increments to users. This approach allows for rapid adaptation to changes and ensures that the platform evolves based on real user needs and insights. As the sole founder, I currently wear all hats, handling product development, marketing, design, and overall strategy. While this approach ensures a deep understanding of every aspect of the business, it will need to evolve as the company grows and requires additional expertise and resources.

**Operating Costs**\
Operating costs are privately funded through revenue from other ventures under 47products (Pty) Ltd, such as software development services and consulting for small and medium-sized enterprises. These ventures provide a foundation for initial funding and support Neighbour Approved's early-stage development. While this model has been effective in the early stages, it is not sustainable as Neighbour Approved grows and incurs additional operational demands. Securing external funding or revenue will be critical for future scalability and sustainability.

**Revenue Model**\
Neighbour Approved’s revenue model is subscription-based, designed to meet the needs of living estates and gated communities in residential and industrial settings. Subscription pricing will be determined based on each community's size and specific needs, ensuring affordability while providing value. This approach will allow flexibility in pricing tiers to cater to different community budgets and requirements. This model represents a future strategy, as revenue generation will only commence once the platform is ready for customers. The planned revenue streams include:

- **Annual Group Subscriptions**: Communities will pay a yearly fee to access the platform and its features.
- **Sponsorship Opportunities**: Members or contractors may sponsor specific subsections within a community, enabling targeted endorsements and increased visibility.
- **Priority Listings**: Communities can allow contractors or contacts to bid for priority listing positions, enhancing their prominence within the platform.
- **Verified Contacts**: For an additional fee, communities and members can verify requests from contacts, ensuring trust and reliability in shared service providers.

**Security**\
All intellectual property (IP) is securely stored in a private GitHub repository and documented within Google Drive, managed by 47products (Pty) Ltd. This ensures the protection and confidentiality of the platform’s proprietary assets.

**Scalability**\
While Neighbour Approved has been designed with scalability in mind, there are no concrete plans for expansion at this stage. Factors such as achieving a stable user base, securing additional funding, and identifying opportunities for integration or market expansion will trigger scalability planning. The focus remains on delivering a functional and reliable platform to support initial adoption and generate early traction.

**What phase of development are you in?**\
Development is in the early stage, with core platform features developed and being tested. This includes core backend, database, and middleware functionality, which are currently undergoing active development and rigorous testing to ensure a secure, stable and scalable foundation for the application.

**Which of Yenza's Services do you require?**

- Software Engineering
- CTO & Investment Advisory Services

**What is the Problem Statement you are addressing?**\
Lack of a centralised and trustworthy platform for members of living estates to recommend and endorse service providers and contractors. An additional problem being addressed is the recycling of contacts within community WhatsApp groups, which could potentially be an integration consideration for the future. This integration could include features like importing contacts from WhatsApp groups into the platform, streamlining endorsements, and ensuring the most relevant and reliable information is accessible to community members. The platform would further enhance trust and usability for its target audience by addressing this issue.

**How are you solving this problem?**\
Creating a secure platform that allows members to add, categorise, and endorse trusted contractors or businesses ensures quality and reliability for community use.

**Who is your target market?**\
Living estates, gated communities, and other groups requiring vetted service providers.

**How does your startup make money (who buys what and why)?**\
Neighbour Approved charges communities (e.g., estates) a subscription fee for platform access. Communities value the ability to securely manage and share trusted service providers. Sponsorships are also allowed for communities and service providers.
