# Test Architecture Document

## Overview

This document outlines the test architecture for the **Neighbour Approved** application. The goal is to achieve comprehensive test coverage across all layers of the application, ensuring reliability, maintainability, and performance. Testing will align with the application's modular architecture, adhering to best practices for test design and execution.

---

## Test Objectives

1. **Functionality**: Validate that all components meet functional requirements.
2. **Performance**: Ensure optimal performance under expected and peak loads.
3. **Security**: Verify adherence to security standards, including data protection and access control.
4. **Usability**: Confirm the user experience is intuitive and meets requirements.
5. **Maintainability**: Enable easy updates with minimal risk through regression testing.

## Test Strategy

### Levels of Testing

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Scope: Individual functions, methods, and classes.
   - Tools: `pytest`, `unittest`.
   - Goal: Ensure that each unit of code performs as intended.

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Scope: Interaction between modules (e.g., service and repository layers).
   - Tools: `pytest`, `docker-compose` for environment setup.
   - Goal: Validate seamless module communication and data flow.

3. **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**
   - Scope: Complete workflows from API to database and back.
   - Tools: `pytest`, `Selenium`, `Playwright`.
   - Goal: Simulate real-world use cases and verify end-user scenarios.

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Scope: System responsiveness and stability under load.
   - Tools: `Locust`, `JMeter`.
   - Goal: Identify bottlenecks and ensure the application meets performance SLAs.

5. **Security Testing**
   - Scope: Application vulnerabilities, data integrity, and access control.
   - Tools: `OWASP ZAP`, `Bandit`.
   - Goal: Ensure compliance with security best practices.

6. **Regression Testing**
   - Scope: Ensure new changes do not introduce defects.
   - Tools: Automated test suites.
   - Goal: Maintain system stability during iterations.

### Test Naming Convention

- **Unit Tests**: `test_<function_or_class>_<expected_behavior>`
- **Integration Tests**: `test_<module_interaction>_<expected_behavior>`
- **E2E Tests**: `test_<workflow>_<expected_outcome>`

### Test Case Template

| Test ID    | Description         | Steps                  | Expected Outcome      | Status |
|------------|---------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|--------|
| TC001      | User Login          | 1. Enter credentials  | User is logged in     | Pass   |
| TC002      | Create Contact      | 1. Add valid details   | Contact is created    | Pass   |

## Tools and Frameworks

1. **Testing Frameworks**: `pytest`, `unittest`
2. **Mocking**: `pytest-mock`, `unittest.mock`
3. **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions for automated test execution
4. **Coverage**: `coverage.py` for tracking test coverage
5. **Load Testing**: `Locust`
6. **Static Analysis**: `Pylint`, `Bandit`

---

## Automation Strategy

- **Unit Tests**:
  - Triggered on every push and pull request to main.
  - Executes within isolated environments using Docker.

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Triggered on merges to main and scheduled nightly builds.
  - Requires database containers initialized with mock data.

- **E2E Tests**:
  - Triggered on feature completion or major releases.
  - Utilizes headless browsers and real API endpoints.

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Executed during staging.
  - Measures performance against predefined SLAs.

- **Security Tests**:
  - Run periodically and as part of the release pipeline.

## Metrics and Reporting

### Metrics

1. **Test Coverage**: Target 90% coverage for critical modules.
2. **Test Pass Rate**: 95% minimum for all automated tests.
3. **Defect Leakage**: Measure number of production issues post-release.

### Reporting

- **Tools**: Allure, SonarQube
- **Frequency**: Per CI/CD pipeline run and weekly summaries

---

## Best Practices

1. Use fixtures for reusable test data.
2. Mock external dependencies to isolate tests.
3. Write idempotent tests.
4. Use parameterized tests for better coverage.
5. Regularly update and clean up test suites.

## Conclusion

The test architecture provides a structured approach to validating the Neighbour Approved application across multiple dimensions. By adhering to this strategy, the project will maintain high-quality standards while ensuring a robust, secure, and performant system.
