## Introduction

Trunk-based deployment is a modern software development strategy where all developers commit to a single shared branch, commonly called **trunk** or **main**. This approach enhances collaboration, reduces integration complexity, and allows for faster and more reliable deployments.

### Why Use Trunk-Based Development?

- Reduces merge conflicts by integrating changes frequently.
- Enables **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment (CD)**.
- Promotes code quality with automated testing and short-lived feature branches.
- Supports a **DevOps culture** by reducing hand-offs between teams.

## Key Concepts

### Trunk

- The **main branch** where all developers commit their changes.
- Kept in a deployable state at all times.

### Short-Lived Feature Branches

- Branches created from **trunk** for feature development.
- Merged back into trunk within a short time (ideally 1-2 days).

### Continuous Integration (CI)

- Developers push code frequently.
- Automated tests ensure trunk stability.

### Continuous Deployment (CD)

- Trunk is always in a deployable state.
- Code changes are released to production frequently.

## Branching Strategy

A simple branching model is followed:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Trunk (Main)] -->|Short-lived feature branches| B[Feature Branch 1]
    A --> C[Feature Branch 2]
    B -->|Merge back quickly| A
    C -->|Merge back quickly| A
```

### Guidelines

- Keep feature branches **short-lived** (merge within a few days).
- Regularly pull updates from **trunk** to avoid drift.
- Use **feature flags** to manage incomplete features in production.

## Deployment Workflow

### 1. Development

- Developers create a **feature branch** from trunk.
- Write code and ensure unit tests pass.

### 2. Continuous Integration (CI)

- Push changes to **feature branch**.
- Run automated tests to ensure correctness.

### 3. Code Review & Merge

- Open a **pull request (PR)** to trunk.
- Conduct code reviews and merge changes quickly.

### 4. Continuous Deployment (CD)

- Automated deployment process triggered when code is merged to trunk.
- Use feature flags for unfinished features.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as Developer
    participant Repo as Repository
    participant CI as CI System
    participant Prod as Production

    Dev->>Repo: Push feature branch
    Repo->>CI: Trigger build and tests
    CI-->>Dev: Test results (Pass/Fail)
    Dev->>Repo: Merge into trunk after approval
    Repo->>CI: Deploy to staging
    CI->>Prod: Deploy to production
```

## Automated Testing and CI/CD

To maintain stability, a **CI/CD pipeline** is essential:

1. **Pre-merge Checks**

   - Linting and static analysis
   - Unit tests

2. **Post-merge Validations**

   - Integration tests
   - Regression tests

3. **Deployment Steps**

   - Deploy to **staging** first
   - Deploy to **production** after approval

## Best Practices

- **Always commit to trunk frequently**.
- **Feature branches should not live long** (preferably less than a week).
- **Automate tests** to catch errors early.
- **Monitor deployments** for issues.
- **Use feature flags** instead of long-lived branches.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Issue             | Cause                | Solution                              |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Merge conflicts   | Long-lived branches  | Keep branches short, merge frequently |
| Broken deployment | Insufficient testing | Strengthen CI/CD checks               |
| Rollback needed   | Bug in production    | Use feature flags to toggle changes   |

## Glossary

- **Trunk**: The main branch where all developers integrate their changes.
- **Feature Branch**: A temporary branch for implementing a new feature.
- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.
- **Feature Flags**: A method to enable/disable features in production.
